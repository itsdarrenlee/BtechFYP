# Project Title: A data-driven approach to healthcare treatment with smartwatches

The aim of the project is then to utilize the different metrics from the smart watches and use them to categorize the quality of health of a patient. With the knowledge from the data collection, we could then have a trained machine learning model from which we could interpret and draw conclusions from.

1. Phase 1: Literature Research
Research into different watches, heart rate monitors, smart devices that track body metrics, and/or glucose levels. 
Have a detailed analysis of what are the terms being measured and what is typically acceptable and what is abnormal

2. Phase 2: Experimentation
Decide if funding is available for purchase of a device to collect measurements, i.e. Abbott Libre Sense, or Apple Watch/Samsung Gear, etc, and if it is worthwhile self collecting data
Purchase said device and begin self controlled trials with monitoring of potential confounding factors OR narrow down specific datasets that provide information, and begin to scrape data from them

3. Phase 3: Modelling of data
With collected data from self trials, and in tandem with the other members, begin data modelling approach and decide on fixed variables for which ML/AI can be performed to provide insights
Rinse and repeat with different slices of data, and different software engineering approaches.
